# Intro
I am an Oregon State and Penn State alumnus, where I studied computer science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. My research revolves meta-science and large-language model capabilities. In my spare time, I enjoy video games, learning, teaching, fitness, and the outdoors.
As a recent graduate from Penn State with a Masters in Informatics, I am seeking an artificial intelligence/machine learning engineering position or a software engineering position adjacent to AI/ML.
Generally speaking, if my work contributes towards the improvement of the human condition in some fashion, I will love what I do.
If you feel the need to reach out, please do not hesitate; it is no bother to me.
